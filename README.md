## Inspiration

The pain that one goes through while trying to shortilist a program for their masters study! Through EduSight, we aim to make the decision process as easy as possible by presenting you with the inferences and insights that would help you with the selection process.

## What it does

EduSight provides comsumable insights that helps users get a clear understanding about the pros and cons of various programs. By leveraging supporting from the community and with in-depth information about the various programs that a user wants to know about.

For Example: 
- A 3D scatter plot of programs based on Cost of tuition, Brand Value and Return on Investment 
- A 2D scatter plot of programs based on cost of tuition and ease of getting into the program
- A spider plot of paramertes such as brand value, research publications count, location advantage, cohort strength and course intensity

While the genral notion for shortlisting a master's program is just grouping it into easy, medium and hard buckets, investing about 40 ~ 90L INR is not a simple thing, and having such insights would help a student get better clarity on the programs rather than just going ahead with the easy, medium and hard buckets.

Further apart from providing these data-driven actionable insights, EduSight also supports students via its QnA & Discussion forum, where registered members can have their questions and doubts answered by the community. 

## How we built it

For this POC we have used HTML and CSS, as we wanted to showcase the idea first!

## Challenges we ran into

The challenge with this project was more along the lines of figuering out the flow for the application and bring out the idea. We aim to place EduSight apart from pre-existing services and websites in the market that are providing the same information available all over the internet. 

Some of our team members were rusty with their programing skills, this hackathon helped them get back in touch.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the prototype that we have come up with within the short span of time in this hackathon. We were able to stick to the idea that we wanted to showcase and we believe we have done a pretty neat job at it. Further, we are excited about taking this project ahead as an opens ource project and we are proud to be one of the few people who laid down the foundations for it.

## What we learned

Many of us are first timers here. While some of our team mates, learnt about building an UI within a short span of time, others learnt how hackathons can be an amazing opportunity to quickly get started with a prototype and get the ball rolling!

## What's next for EduSight

- We aim to invite our friends and fellow hackers to join us in building this projects together as we believe that if this is set up as a fully functional website that performs as it is intended, it would help a lot of students who are going theought their master's application process.
- Further we aim to include a blog page , where registered members can contribute articles where they write about their MS application process experience. 
- Set up a resources section, where registered members, can contribute SOP, LOR and CV templates
- Include a file hosting service, so that students can have all their application materials for each college and program readily accesible at a single place
- Building a feature for mentor and alumni connects through which users can get feedback on their essays, resumes and also get insights about their colleges from the alumni
